## Overview
This lab simulates a controlled exposure environment where built-in protections on Windows 10 virtual machines are intentionally disabled. The goal is to understand how vulnerabilities are discovered, assessed, prioritized, and remediated using Microsoft services. You’ll gain a practical, step-by-step experience of how risk posture changes as configurations are weakened and later restored.

## How It Works
1. **Setup Phase** – Deploy Windows 10 virtual machines and adjust configurations to intentionally weaken security (e.g., disabling Defender, updates, and firewall).  
2. **Assessment Phase** – Run scans and inventory checks using Microsoft vulnerability management capabilities to identify potential risks.  
3. **Prioritization Phase** – Evaluate findings based on severity, exploitability, and business impact.  
4. **Remediation Phase** – Apply patches, re-enable baselines, and enforce compliance settings.  
5. **Verification Phase** – Re-scan and compare the new results to confirm reduced exposure.

## Learning Focus
- Setting up a secure and isolated environment for testing insecure configurations  
- Observing effects of disabling key Windows 10 protections  
- Performing end-to-end vulnerability assessments using Microsoft services  
- Applying remediation and verifying security posture improvements  
- Understanding how real-world misconfigurations translate into measurable risk  

## Cost or Resource Composition
The three animated rings represent how resource usage and focus shift across the lab’s lifecycle:

- **Exposure Setup** – Initial VM provisioning and configuration adjustments  
- **Assessment & Prioritization** – Discovery and triage of vulnerabilities  
- **Remediation & Verification** – Patching, baselining, and re-scanning  

These proportions dynamically change to visualize where most effort or cost occurs at different phases of the project.
