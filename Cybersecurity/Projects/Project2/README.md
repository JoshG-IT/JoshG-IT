## Overview
This lab intentionally relaxes selected controls on Windows 10 virtual machines in a safe, isolated environment, then walks the full vulnerability-management loop: discovery, prioritization, remediation, and verification.

## How It Works

</p>

1. **Expose** — Create lab VMs and lower specific baselines to simulate risk.  
2. **Assess** — Inventory systems and scan for vulnerabilities/misconfigurations.  
3. **Prioritize** — Rank by severity, exploitability, and exposure; map to SLAs.  
4. **Remediate** — Patch, re-enable baselines, and verify via re-scan & deltas.

## Learning Focus
- End-to-end vulnerability lifecycle practice  
- Safe exposure simulation in a contained lab  
- Evidence-based prioritization and SLA planning  
- Verification and reporting for closure

| Category              | Description                         | Share |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|:----:|
| Exposure Simulation   | Lab setup, snapshots, rollback      | 25%  |
| Assessment            | Scanning, evidence collection       | 30%  |
| Prioritization        | Risk triage, SLA mapping            | 20%  |
| Remediation & Verify  | Patching, validation, reporting     | 25%  |
